            Review: Though the series is only two seasons in, SpyXFamily is a hit worldwide for a reason. The show balances the comedy of the Forger family with the tragic nature of war perfectly. The protagonists are all balanced characters who, despite having special abilities, also have their own endearing flaws. The pacing for the show keeps interest up without skirting too fast over serious plot points. The inevitable reveal of the Families secrets is still far off but even knowing that I still want to be along for the ride. This is the perfect anime for both new and seasoned watchers and will have a place in my heart long after it’s done.
