        <h2>Tuna Steak Cooked Simple and Savory</h2> 
        <h2>Why I love this Recipe!</h2>
        <p> As a pescaterian, I'm limited in what I can eat. Coupled with the fact that I'm not a good chef, my usual go to food has something to do with eggs
            The main reason I haven't gone full on vegetarian is my love of seafood. Especially that of Tuna steak. When not eating it sashmi style, I prefer my steak to be coated with seasame seeds
            and cooked as rare as possible. Like the fish should still be flopping around a bit. The reciple below not only shows the best way to cook such a fish but also a delicious sauce that can be used 
            to exemplify the Tuna's already fresh taste!
        </p>
